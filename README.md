Creating coding assessment

## Description
The objective for this assignment was to build a timed coding assessment that ran in the browser and featured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. 
### User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Getting Started

1. No starter code was provided.
2. Created new folder to hold contents of starter code (index.html, css stylesheet, javascript, jQuery).
3. Verified content in VS code.
4. Created new repository in GitHub for code.
5. Linked VS code and repository in GitHub.

## Executing
1. Set up the build for my HTML page by with the basic boiler plate setting. Added text, tags, the image and created classes and ids.
2. Built my JavaScript code. First decided what my variables would be (nouns) and then my processes (verbs). This step was a lot of trial and error, debugging.
3. I didn't want my quiz to be completely blank so I added simple CSS for my background, font, and my buttons.

## Conclusion
I was able to build a coding assessment based on the criteria provided.

## Conclusion

After putting all my elements together, I was able to create a coding assessment based on the criteria.
